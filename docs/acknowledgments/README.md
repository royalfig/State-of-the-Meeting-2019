# 🌷 Acknowledgments

The History of Science Society's annual meeting takes a village and then some.

- Our attendees weathered less than ideal circumstances to keep the meeting moving forward, to put it lightly. Heat, hunger, and jet lag is a dangerous combination, but our attendees were patient, gracious, and amiable. Thank you.
- Our program co-chairs, Christine von Oertzen and Simon Werret, had the unenviable task of trying to organize 800 exceptionally strong submissions into an interesting and coherent program. Thank you.

- HSS Committees, like the Commitee on Meetings and Programs ...

- The Local Arrangements Committee, constituted by ..., made the HSS meeting possible. They were our liason to the Utrecht University, our translators, our local organizers, and our guides to everything Dutch. Thank you.

See some of the praise from attendees for the Local Arrangements Committee and Utrecht volunteers below.

<pullQuote title="Very pleasant venue, good signage, friendly and knowledgeable student
assistants." />
<pullQuote title="I mostly want to praise them for the incredibly fantastic job. They
immediately understood that the one thing that was urgently needed (on
top of everything else) was cold water everywhere, and a lot of it. This
worked excellently well. I also was impressed by their ability to reschedule
sessions spontaneously into rooms with AC. Top job!! Thank you very, very
much!!" />
<pullQuote title="They were fantastic!! They worked with unusual conditions and rose to the
challenge-impressive!" />
<pullQuote title="The local organizers did a fantastic job, especially in light of the changes
that needed to be made as a result of the unusual temperatures. I think this
was the best-ever HSS meeting I've attended." />
<pullQuote title="I think they did a heroic job in unprecedented climatic conditions. I really
appreciated the water (including the 'real' fruity water), the reusable drink
flask, the efficiency of registration etc., the resources of the institution as a
whole. I know this is not a suggestion, but I would like to express it anyway,
since it was one of the best HSS meetings I have attended!" />

<pullQuote title="The student assistants were uniformly awesome -- super helpful and
friendly and doing a great job. Thanks!" />
<pullQuote title="A big thank you for the extremely smooth organisation!
The 'Crew' was always easily recognisable with their yellow shirts, they
were everywhere (which was amazing), and also did a really good job in
pointing people into the right direction for the lectures. A suburb
organisation, thanks!" />
<pullQuote title="This was a very successful congress, due to your (typically Dutch)
preparation and hard work. :-)
Communication was excellent.
You did an EXCELLENT job of addressing the heat emergency. This type
of situation is a Local Arrangements Committee's worst nightmare. You
kept everyone safe, calm, and engaged. Every session I attended, even on
the hottest two days, had a good audience. The Descartes students in the
yellow shirts were FANTASTIC. They were a key to your success, as well
as the hard-working organizers.
Congratulations! And thank you very much for hosting us so generously." />
<pullQuote title="The staff and technicians on the ground were excellent! They were kind,
knowledgeable, responsive, patient, and numerous!!" />
